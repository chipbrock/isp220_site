# Motion, Getting From Here to There {#lessonmotion}

>You like to move it move it. Move it.

<p class="message" markdown="1">
Galileo Galilei lived a long and tempestuous life. When he began his work as a mathematician, the world was a place of magic and superstition. An object moved according to mysterious rules, fast or slow, whether straight or curved vaguely according to its Nature, its fire-air-water-earth composition. Explaining, much less predicting, how things moved wasn't even a serious question. Philosophers owned that subject and their thinking was rigid and unimaginative. By the time he died, ill and blind at the age of 77, Galileo had established our modern relationship with Nature. His scientific descendants no longer wondered *whether* the world was knowable and regular. Their research program became---and is now--- *what are the precise mathematical rules* that describe the motions---of all things. Vagueness became unwelcome. Precision was the game. <br><br>
Modeling motion was the beginning of physics and this lesson tells that story. <br><br>
This lesson is a little more...deliberate than the others will be. We have some language to get straight. I need for you to become familiar with the "rules of engagement" in the material. If you proceed carefully, you'll be in a good position to take the rest of QS&BB in stride. Also, I think Galileo was pretty neat.

## A Little Bit of Galileo {#motiongalileo}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

"Galileo." What comes to mind when you hear his name? That trial? A famous experiment involving a tall building? The "father of physics"? All things you might find in a short search. But there's much more to this complicated man, so often the subject of fables that quickly grew up around his life and his sad end.

> Leonardo, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Dante, Raphael, GaGa, Galileo, ..but not "Albert." 

It's been customary for centuries to refer to famous Italians by one, usually their first name (sometimes, their hometown). So "Galileo" is instantly recognizable and familiar. But as his was an impossible life, we can't just get away with the one-name thing in a simple way. *No, this guy had to have two first names*! Galileo Galilei. Why's that?

Lesson {ref}`introduction`.

Our Galileo's great-grandfather's brother (are you with me?) Galileo Bonaiuti was a renown physician and professor at the University of Florence in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. This overlapped with the consolidation of "informal" power in Florence by the original banker-to-Europe Cosimo de' Medici who managed the republican governance in Florence behind the scenes. 

> The Medici family – ruthless and yet extravagant patrons of the arts – included multiple cardinals and two popes –  was directly involved with our Galileo. By his time, the family had acquired hereditary status as first, the Duchy of Florence, and then the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Galileo's relationship was then with royalty.  They reigned in Tuscany until the early part of the 18th century.

Galileo's great-great-great uncle's role in Florence was as a part of the governing council of the city, so he was intellectually and politically powerful. He would have been close to Cosimo. Someone for a family to look up to. And they did: the family changed its surname to "Galilei" and the fact that our Galileo's father then named him twice for his famous ancestor sets the stage for what was expected of him, doesn't it.

Galileo Galilei  <br>  1564-1642 <br> "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."
```

Galileo Galilei was a loyal friend to many – eventually a famous man in Europe – but at the same time he attracted fierce and dangerous enemies. He was an accomplished musician and literary critic and yet not above vulgar student poetry aimed at stuffy professors. He was passionately independent and yet a shameless flatterer of the wealthy and powerful. His science was novel, bold, and cutting-edge, but he couldn't shake allegiance to perfectly circular planetary orbits nor break out of the ancient geometry of Euclid and Archimedes while the rest of intellectual Europe was moving into decimal points, logarithms, trigonometry, and algebra. He was, and still is an enigma. Much like Einstein.

```{sidebar} My sidebar title

```

He's a fascinating character from a fascinating time – a contemporary of Shakespeare, Elizabeth I, Francis Bacon, Johannes Kepler, Tycho de Brahe, and Rene Descartes. A cosmopolitan public figure and intellectual, yet a homebody – never straying outside of a circle of 150 miles in radius, to only Rome, Florence, and Venice.

Galileo studied many topics in what he would have called natural philosophy, but two major scientific paths will concern us: his research and enduring conclusions about motion and astronomy. In this lesson, we'll follow his ideas about motion and postpone his astronomy...and the famous trial...for a later lesson.

### Early Life

Dad wanted his Galileo to become a physician as a proud citizen of Florence – but it didn't happen and – besides, he wasn't from Florence! Our Galileo was born in Pisa but always considered himself a proud Florentine, where he lived only after the age of 10 when his father could quit working in his wife's family business. Vincenzo Galileo (1564-1642) was a musician and his family struggled to maintain its dignity,  but their circumstances never lived up to their legendary ancestor, or Vincenzo's aspirations.  He married Pisan Giulia Ammannati and settled for a dowery of linen and woolen cloth – from the Ammannati business. Vincenzo  himself worked in Pisa in their firm, but reluctantly, as he was an accomplished musician and is even credited today with inspiring the invention of opera. He was also a tiny bit cantankerous.

> It appears to me that they who in proof of anything rely simply on the weight of authority, without adducing any argument in support of it, act very absurdly.

This could easily have been our Galileo's sentiment, but it was a statement of his father's. The fellow who got into a furious public argument with one of his teachers. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. (We'll do apples in *QS&BB*).

![appletree](images/motion/appletree.png)

Galileo had two surviving sisters, Virginia and Lena (and another sister and brother who died quite young) and a ne'er-do-well brother, Michelagnolo, who became an absent professional lutenist. Absent when it came time to helping to pay for the dowries for Virginia and Lena (which resulted in lawsuits from their brothers in law)...but present when he begged for loans from his older brother. Much of Galileo's life and decisions about employment centered on his need to financially support his family. His mother was demanding after Vincenzo's untimely death, even hiring one of Galileo's servants to spy on his financial situation.

```{margin} An optional title

```



Vincenzo eventually returned to Florence performing and composing  full time and established young Galileo's primary education nearby. For a brief time, Galileo was sent to the monastery Vallambrosa, where he was later kidnapped by his father when it appeared that the 11 year old Galileo might commit to taking holy vows. Later, he would briefly teach at the monastery where behind his back he was called *sfrattato* ("evicted person").

### As a Student

While a medical student at the University of Pisa, Galileo accidentally discovered an aptitude for mathematics. A physician needed mathematics in order to practice astronomy in order to cast horoscopes. So mathematics was in his curriculum. The Medici family would move to Pisa during the summer months and an entire entourage would follow which included teachers for the younger princes. Galileo, as the story goes, happened on some outdoor classes on Euclid's geometry and found it interesting and then became devoted. The instructor, Ostilio Ricci, Court Mathematician to the Grand Duke Francesco, recognized his talent and tutored him privately – and clandestinely. Galileo stopped going to medical classes and fully concentrated on mathematics. Dad found out.

After a tough negotiation at home, he eventually abandoned medicine, leaving the university a year short of his degree. By this time he was doing original mathematical research (in geometry) and had caught the attention of scholars in Pisa and Rome.

Galileo made a name for himself at the university – as shockingly disrespectful. Even at a young age, he was allergic to fools and he found the faculty overstocked in that category.[^fools]  He was also impossibly resistant to the regimented intellectual system of all European universities: in every subject, philosophy, mathematics, law, logic, rhetoric, and astronomy it was Aristotle, all the time. Particularly galling to Galileo was Aristotle's physics and there he was in good company since Aristotle's ideas about motion had not made sense to anyone for two centuries, but his authority was absolute. Galileo — like his father — didn’t “do” authority.

[^fools]: He wrote low poetry making fun of them and their sometimes affection for brothels.

He lived at home for three years and gave private mathematics lessons in Florence and Sienna while he cultivated patrons for help in finding a university position.  After some rejections, he succeeded...back at the University of Pisa as a lecturer of mathematics. Where his welcome was underwhelming.

His reputation as an original mathematician was growing when his father died. As a consequence he inherited the responsibility of a significant dowry for one married sister and responsibility to provide for the other’s wedding. He spent the rest of his life in search of a higher salary and ways to augment his income, which as a lowly mathematician at Pisa was a quarter of that of a philosophy professor. He got his break when he was offered the position of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Padua, among the most prestigious universities in Europe and safely in the progressive Republic of Venice. It was at Padua where the Galileo magic happened.

## The Medieval Version of Here to There: A Little Bit of Aristotle {#motiongreek}

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Look around you – everything is in flux. Things fall, birds fly, you move across a room, you throw a ball, the Sun is in a different spot in the sky during the day, and the stars appear to move from east to west during the night. Why? How? Our experience shows that all events but those in the sky are individual events. Throw a ball, and its motion will be slightly different each time. Regular, reliable motions appear to be reserved for the celestial bodies.

The correct understanding of everyday motion was long in coming and by Galileo's time, everyone thought that Aristotle had nailed it, albeit with some embarrassments. Classical works had been out of reach of Europe until Greek philosophy and science essentially fell into Europe's lap in the form of hundreds of conflicting Arabic translations in the 1300s. But translation of Aristotle’s *Physics* from original Greek, to Arabic, and then to Latin did not make his ideas any less confused than they originally were.

Aristotle, revered as “The Philosopher,”  invented formal logic that taught people how to evaluate arguments. But while the Philosopher’s methods were refreshing when applied against church authority by Parisian college students, his ideas about motion were confused at best – but nonetheless became firmly stuck in the academic and Church communities where they were protected as *philosophy*, not as *science*.

Not until the end of the 16th century did Galileo shed Aristotle and lay the groundwork for the first systematic understanding of what it means for something to move. It took three centuries! Let's lay out the basics of The Philosopher's mechanics so we'll have something to throw logical darts at.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Aristotle's Mechanics and Astronomy

For Aristotle there were three kinds of motion: two "natural" and one "unnatural."

**Natural motion near the Earth** was in a *straight line*, either *down*  or *up* relative to the center of the Universe, which he located at the center of the Earth. The speed of downward motion depended on the amount of “earthy” composition of the object, and so *its weight.* If there was a lot of earthiness – think a rock – the object went down. If it had the property of "lightness" (a quality that's foreign to us) it went up – think fire. So the apparent fact that every event we observe is a little different from every other event can be ascribed to the variations in the material composition of real things.

**Natural motion beyond the orbit of the Moon** was to be *circular* with every extraterrestrial body attached to its own rotating crystalline sphere. These spheres were all nested with common centers and rotated around the Earth to account for the apparently circular orbits that we see from the Earth. They included all of the known planets, the Sun, and the Moon, and even the stars all together in the outermost shell. 

**Unnatural motion** was different. It only happens on Earth and it required a pusher, an active force that was in physical contact with the object throughout the motion. Therein lay one of the most obvious flaws in his model.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Rather than one consistent set of rules, Aristotle insisted that there were different physical laws for different parts of the universe. </p>
It's child's play to make fun of these ideas. And I will. But Aristotle was describing what he saw in his everyday life and trying to fit it together into his much bigger, intricately stitched-together philosophical structure. Pull at one piece of that system and the whole thing tumbles apart like a game of Jenga. So while his physics was bizarre and wrong, it stuck. *It had to stick* because following the genius of St. Thomas Aquinas, Catholicism had hitched its wagon to the hard-to-ignore Aristotelian philosophy. But people knew for centuries that it had problems.

> There were a number of other issues with his physics, like his "four causes" which made things move because they had some desire to find a natural place. But we'll not go there. Okay. I'll go there a little. Motion was not only for moving objects in space. A cat growing into a kitten was a form of motion. A seed growing into a plant was a form of motion and the seed's desire was to reach that plant-ness as a matter of fulfillment. Now take this into the kind of motion that we care about – is Locomotion – and you'll see why I didn't go there. Much.

<p class="pullquote" >
Galileo uncovered the modern notion of how things move and persuasively rid the intellectual community of Aristotle’s baggage.  
</p>

He began to rebel while at Pisa, where he wrote an unpublished manuscript, *de Motu* (“On Motion”). These were immature ideas, but he was onto something. One of his conclusions was right on: all objects fall at the same rate, contrary to Aristotle’s insistence that heavier objects fell faster. His data? Not the *Leaning Tower of Pisa*. That’s a myth. He too looked around him. And saw things differently.


<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## Getting From Here to There: At Constant Speed {#motionconstant}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Motion is both the easiest and the hardest concept in physics and so much of what comes for us will constantly stretch at ideas about what motion is and how we can describe it. So we need to start at the beginning.

You've been dropping things since you were a toddler and you learned the hard way that if you drop something from a high place it will more likely break than from a low height. You learned that the harder you throw a ball, the faster it will leave your hand, the more damage it can do to a window, and the farther it will go before landing---and that it always comes down.

1. If time doesn’t march on, we’ve not moved. But what is time? “Tubby...paused. 'Time,' he added slowly -- 'time is what keeps everything from happening at once…" [^time] We'll see time take on a new meaning.
2. The final frontier, Space, is either “just there” or it’s a relationship among extended objects. If all of the things in the universe disappeared, is there space left over? That's an old, contentious issue and maybe was finally solved by Einstein.
3. What’s the difference between space and time? In “speed” they are just two sides of the same coin, or two sides of the same ratio. But don't you usually think of them as different things? One’s not more important than the other is it? Eventually, we'll let Einstein chime in here.
4. Particular speeds seem to be important. Mr. Galileo taught us about one and James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein taught us about another. (There he is again.)


[^time]: This is often attributed to Einstein, Woody Allen, and John Wheeler! It actually comes from Ray Cummings' short story *The Time Professor* from 1921. Stick with me. You'll learn all sorts of odd facts.

From that simple word-equation, so sensible and so obvious, I've hinted at at least five complications. We have learned to ask simple questions and discover that they sometimes lead to important and surprising directions.

>**motion: it’s everywhere**<br>
>Almost everything in physics boils down to: motion. (Even boiling.)

Whether it’s runners on a track, the cosmic rays piercing us all the time, orbiting planets, electrons in a wire, electromagnetic waves, quark wavefunctions inside a proton, electrons and holes in a semiconductor, or the stretching of spacetime itself. Everything is about "motion."

These first lessons on the physics of my grandparents’ generation will establish the language and tools that we’ll need in order to pursue the more exotic forms of motion and we’ll become skilled at manipulating concepts (and their attendant symbols) like velocity, kinetic energy, mass, momentum, and force. Each of these terms has a sixteenth to nineteenth century origin, but each has managed to keep up with the times as layer upon layer of subtlety is discovered about each of them as we dig deeper and discover more.

But at its most basic, our physics will be all about how to get from <em>here</em> to <em> there</em> and from <em> then</em> to <em> now</em>, and to be able to explain how that happened and predict what will come next.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Speed in Modern Terms

 Let’s make this more compact by inserting customary symbols to get rid of the English words. Here are some grammar rules in QS&BB:

-   We’ll limit ourselves almost exclusively to motion in one dimension
   in space.

-   We’ll use the symbol $v$ for speed (because customarily, we’ll speak
   of “velocity”…more about this below).

-   We’ll use the symbol $x$ for distance in one dimension, regardless
   of which direction it points.

-   We’ll use the symbol $t$ for time and almost always presume that we
   set our clocks so that the beginning time of any interval is
    $t_0=0$.

-   Oh, and we’ll use the subscript $\text{ }_{0}$ to indicate the beginning of some time or location interval---" $t_0$" or  " $x_0$ ”---in a sequence of events.

-   We’ll use the Greek symbol Delta, $\Delta$ to mean “change of”…this
   will come up a lot.


<!--See. You already know a lot about motion. Let's go “up north.”-->

<!-- # ``` -->

<!--You see the various towns along the way and in this trip we'll be abstract in a couple of ways. That curvy line following the actual roads we'll pretend is just straight so we could define a coordate system with $x$ following the SE to NW path and in which $x=0$ is at Comerica Park. The second way we could abstract this scenario is to imagine that we're so good at the controls that we can drive at a constant 60 mph the whole way---no stopping, no slowing down or speeding up.--> 

<!--If our copilot got our her watch and wrote down the time that we breezed through Saginaw, Grayling, and when we got to the bridge she could create a graph which would look like this.-->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/mackinac.png') -->
<!-- ``` -->



<!--It's a lot easier to use numbers rather than names and clock times so let's replace the names of the towns with their distances from the beginning and use decimal hours on the horizontal axis starting at the 4 o'clock point which we have the freedom to define to be $t_0 = 0$.-->

<!-- ``` -->


<!--That straight line in the distance plot is a familiar thing and we'll model that in Lesson \@ref(lessonmotion). But there's a lot there. If we carefully made this plot before we left, then if asked, we could say how long it will take us to get to Grayling.-->

<!-- > <!--**Question!** So, how long will it take to get to Grayling at a constant 60 mph? <br>-->
<!-- > <!--**Glad you asked.** I just follow the $y$ axis to the right from the 200 mi point until I hit the line and then read down from there and get: about three and a quarter hours. <br>--> 
<!-- > <!--**Good job!**-->

<!-- > <!--**Question!** The fact that the line of distance versus time is straight means what? <br>-->
<!-- > <!--**Glad you asked.** No matter where we are on the graph (on the road!), the rate at which distance increases is the same anywhere along the way. From the park to Saginaw, it's $100$ miles/about $1.7$ hours which is about $59~$mph. From Saginaw to Grayling is $(200-100)/(3.3-1.7) = 100/1.6 = 63~$mph. The whole trip is $300/5=60~$ mph. I get the same thing everywhere. <br>--> 
<!-- <!--So the straight line of distance versus time for a trip means that the speed is constnat.<br>--> 
<!-- > <!--**Good job!**--> 

<!--Now I don't know about you, but I can't drive precisely at 60 mph for 10 minutes, let alone for 5 hours. So here's a more realistic image of what the distance versus time relation might be.-->

<!--Here the dark line is meant to represent a more realistic journey with the light gray line showing the originally ideal, constant velocity trip.

We fly through Grayling G) on to Vanderbilt (V) and then more slowly, get to the bridge.-->

## Calculating a Speed {#motioncalculatespeed}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Some traditional jargon and nomenclature to make your…okay, *my* life easier. “Change” and “change-of” always means the difference between where you *are* as compared with where you *were*. Suppose I start out with \$100 and Janet gives me \$50. What's the net *change in* my net worth? We can represent this simple transaction as

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta(\text{my wealth}) &= \text{where I ended up} - \text{where I started} \nonumber \\
&= 150 - 100=50 \text{ ...so I'm up 50 bucks} \nonumber \end{align*}$$

which is the definition of our $\Delta$ : always "the end minus the beginning," the final value of some quantity minus the initial value of that quantity. Get it?[^start]

[^start]: So if class starts at 10:20 AM and if I were to fall asleep in mid-sentence at 10:50, it would be embarrassing.  When you posted my snoring image to Instagram you'd calculate that $t_0=10:20$ and $t=10:50$ and so you'd report that I managed to stay awake for $\Delta t=t - t_0 = 30$ minutes.

So let's apply this to physics and remember ... er, a double-remember from Section \@ref(youknowrememberingmotion) where we defined speed:
$$\text{speed} = \text{distance traveled divided the time that it took}$$
and made it into a simple equation:<br><br>
$$\text{speed}=\frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{time that it took}}.$$

So the numerator is a difference (so we'll use our difference symbol, $\Delta$) of where we ended up in space minus where we started in space: $$\text{distance traveled in space }=\Delta x = x_{\text{ended up}}-x_{\text{where we started}}.$$
And the denominator is where we ended up in time minus where we started in time:
$$\text{distance traveled in time }=\Delta t = t_{\text{ended up}}-t_{\text{where we started}}.$$
Lots of words, so we'll use some shorthand.

Using our standard notation in which the “initial state” of any quantity will be decorated with a little "0" subscript, like $x_0$ here. The “final state” will usually have no subscript and just be $x$.  So $$\Delta x = x_{\text{ended up}}-x_{\text{where we started}} = x-x_0$$ and $$\Delta t= t_{\text{ended up}}-t_{\text{when we started}} = t - t_0.$$ 

So our abstracted model for speed is:
$$v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}.$$
Boy is Mr. Einstein going to make this interesting.

**The story of speed**

🖋 📓
Let's work it:

<div class="admonition note" name="html-admonition" style="background: lightyellow; padding: 10px">
<p class="title"><em>Pencil out</em> 🖋 📓</p>

Given what we've done this far, using $\Delta$ notation in the numerator and denominator, we've said:

$$ \begin{equation}
v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x - x_0}{t - t_0}. 
(\#eq:speed)
\end{equation}$$



Often, we'll pretend that we can start our clock at the beginning of some event and so we can usually just let $t_0=0$ and then the symbol $t$ just stands for the time interval as well as the ending time. You'll see.

When you go somewhere, or predict how long it will take to get from one place to another, you would instinctively use an average speed to calculate it. For example, if you travel at a constant 60 mph for 5 hours, how far would you go? 

Get out your fingers and your toes for this calculation...it's $60 \times 5 = 300$ miles, right? You just did something important. Your brain already knows how to take \@ref(eq:speed) and manipulate it a bit:

$$
\begin{align}
v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x - x_0}{t - t_0} \\
v(t-t_0) & =x-x_0 \\
x-x_0 & =v(t-t_0)=(60)(5)=300 \text{ (miles)}.

When you go somewhere, or predict how long it will take to get from one place to another, you would instinctively use an average speed to calculate it. For example, if you travel at a constant 60 mph for 5 hours, how far would you go? 

Get out your fingers and your toes for this calculation...it's $60 \times 5 = 300$ miles, right? You just did something important. Your brain already knows how to take \@ref(eq:speed) and manipulate it a bit:

$$
\begin{align}
v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x - x_0}{t - t_0} \\
v(t-t_0) & =x-x_0 \\
x-x_0 & =v(t-t_0)=(60)(5)=300 \text{ (miles)}.
\end{align}
$$

### A Model for Motion

In that example, we've just created a model for motion, often an equation and a plot figure prominently in a model. In fact, since:

$$x = x_0 + \langle v \rangle (t - t_0)$$

is the equation for a straight line. Do you remember some time in your past algebraic life saying, "y equals m x plus b"  ...$$y=mx + b?$$ Here, "$y$" is our distance, $x$; (briefly, confusingly) $x$ is our time difference, $t$; and $b$ (the slope in the equation) is our average velocity, $\langle v \rangle$.

So we can see that the straight line from our plots has a slope that's equivalent to our average speed. Now I don't know about you, but I can't drive precisely at 60 mph for 10 minutes, let alone for 5 hours. So here's a more realistic image of what the distance versus time relation might be.


```{r morerealistic, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=" (a) A more realistic (?) trip as the distance varies with time. V is Vanderbilt, Michigan where the speed trap is. (b) What does the speed look like?", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/mackinac_real_2copy.png')
```

Here the dark line is meant to represent a more realistic journey with the light gray line showing the originally ideal, constant velocity trip. Notice that we start slow and speed up and then at Saginaw we stop for dinner: the distance is unchanged for almost an hour until point S2 when we start up again. And boy, do we ever. We fly through Grayling (G) on to Vanderbilt (V) and then more slowly, get to the bridge.

Let's analyze this while feeling sorry for ourselves about that speeding ticket.

Can you see that the average speed is the same for the realistic trajectory and the originally idealistic steady-on-the-gas picture? All the average depends on is the beginning and the end.

>**Instantaneous speed **<br><br>
>If you want to know more details, then you'd need shorter time intervals. In each successively smaller interval you'd know the speed more precisely and in the limit where you're just at a point on some curve of distance – well, that's the _instantaneous speed_. That too is an idealistic notion since any measurement of speed would require a finite time interval. Of course your speedometer is calculating an average also, but the time interval is so short that we tend to think of the reading in the cockpit as our speed *right now*.

<div class="penout">🖋 📓

So now we have a functional relationship that acts as a little calculating engine: you give me a time and a speed and your starting point, I'll reliably tell you your new position when your clock reaches that time. The world can be pretty neat that way. Here it is:

$$x = x_0+\langle v \rangle t$$

Often we'll be a little casual about the average sign and we'd just say

$$x = x_0+ v t.$$

## Multiplication and Geometry {#motiongeometry}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Here is a neat way of thinking about algebra that will give us insight into many different circumstances. We'll use it a lot. Let's simplify  our model to be just $x = vt$. Do you notice anything familiar about the _form_ of that equation? Maybe this will remind you. 

Suppose my yard is chalked with foot-long markers. (You mean yours isn't?)

```{r land, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="My yard: (a), now and (b) later.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/land.png')
```


What is the area of my yard? You'd quickly calculate for (a) that it's $20 \times 30 = 600$ square feet, right? That is, you remember that in order to calculate an area you multiply the width times the height:

$$A=E \times N.$$

Suppose now I want to sell an eastern parcel to a neighbor leaving me with only 10 feet of width. But I want the area of my yard to remain the same. That can happen if I can buy land from my northern neighbor. How much do I need to buy? What must the north - south dimension of my yard be in order to keep the area of 600 sqft? The yard drawing in (b) answers that question. We simply modify the area formula

$$N = A/E = 600/10 = 60,$$

making one variable on the right small and the other one large in order to keep the total area the same. Of course you could calculate the area in many ways: cut out the picture and reform it into a different rectangle. Or notice that there are dots in the squares of (a)… count them up and you'll find there are six. So the new yard area also has to have six dots-worth of yard-squares. (Each rectangle is worth 10 sqft as you can see.) We'll make use of this simple idea over and over. 

Like now:

Notice that $$x = vt$$ is actually the equation of a rectangle of "area" $x$ with sides of in velocity ($v$) and time ($t$). We travel 300 miles at a steady 60 mph and it took five hours. We can make a geometrical model of this motion as in (a) below:

​```{r upnortha, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Our trip's model re-envisioned as a solution of areas. (a) is the safe trip in five hours and (b) is the unsafe trip in three hours.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/upnortharea.png')
```


<!-- write it --------------------->
<div class="penout">🖋 📓

Now suppose we're impatient and  we want our trip up north to take three hours rather than five hours. The distance is still the same 300 miles, but now we have to go faster. How much faster? Count the dots (15), cut out each little rectangle and re-form them. See (b) in the diagram. Or, we could just do the simple math:

$$\begin{align}
x &= vt \nonumber  \\
v &= \frac{x}{t} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 100 \text{ mph} \nonumber
\end{align}$$

I don't advise it. But you get my meaning.

We'll be able to do this many times for many different circumstances. Yard acreage or even speeds seem obvious, but we'll encounter more complicated ideas for which this geometrical thinking will actually lead to physics-insight. Trust me, I'm a doctor.

>**algebra and geometry **<br><br>
>I'm impressed by this sort of thing. Look what we did. We took our intuitive notion of a constant speed in an English paragraph, turned it into a simple algebraic equation, and then turned that into a graph that will give our location at any point along the way. And then we insight into the physics by thinking of our speed equation like an "area" equation. This happens often---some algebra leads to a geometrical relation. In physics we tend to treat the plot on par with the equation as an "explanation."

The problem with this story is: how did we magically get to 60 mph? We accelerated and therein is another Galileo story and a fable.

But first, let's visit Spacetime.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## Now For Something Completely Different: Feynman Diagrams {#motionfeynman}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Richard Feynman was an unusual man. We'll rely on him periodically as he explains some tough concepts in often bumper-sticker-sized insights. One of the things he did was create a language for dealing with the bizarre concepts of relativistic quantum field theory (a mouthful, but you'll form those words yourself later) and how we use it to describe the interactions of elementary particles. His language is a sophisticated brand of mathematics, but  it comes with a highly visual diagramatic tool that we can use all by itself. It's already inherent in the graphs we just drew for distance as a function of time for constant speeds. We call that space, Spacetime and Feynman Diagrams are Spacetime Diagrams. Let's think differently from how you may have before.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Space Diagrams and Spacetime Diagrams

Ultimately we'll want to appreciate the collisions of elementary particles and the best image I can think of is a pool table with smooth balls moving around on its surface.  Let's do that. I'll repeatedly refer to two kinds of geometrical spaces:

* **Space Diagram**. A Space Diagram will be a drawing that a moving object might take in space, for us, $x$ and $y$.  Sounds simple. If you were to draw the path you took on a road trip you would mark a line on a map with a pencil, following the roads, right? But implicit in this line is that the time that elapsed in your journey is implied, but not explicit. At every mile-marker on the highway you could have marked down the time and it would be more evident. A  curve in a Space Diagram is a trajectory in space coordinates where time is kind of in the background.
* **Spacetime Diagram**. A Spacetime Diagram is one in which time is now explicit as one of the coordinates. Since paper is two dimensionally flat for us that means we have to imply one of the formerly evident space dimensions and call out only one of the two (two of the three if we were in three-dimensional space). The result is a Spacetime geometry which only became a thing…with the other guy whom we'll be constantly referring to, Albert Einstein. Spacetime is a thing…in his Special Theory of Relativity. A trajectory in Spacetime is a curve drawn between points at particular places at a particular times.

A buzzword: "**Event**." 

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">An **event** is a physical happening at a single point in space and at a single time. </p>

If you have a ruler and a clock…you can fully characterize an event. . Touch your screen right here: $\rightarrow$ x $\leftarrow$ and look at your watch. The coordinates of the “x” spot and the time that you touched it define that physical act completely.

Another buzzword: "**interval**."[^interval]

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">We'll refer to the space and/or time *differences* between two events as an **interval**. </p>

 

[^interval]: This term will have a more specific definition when we meet Mr Einstein.

Some close-reading here:

<div class="penout">🖋 📓

Let's picture a pool table with a single ball engaged in two different interludes. A ball can just sit "still" between two times, minding its own business. A ball can also travel, say, to the right at a constant speed–so it's at one place at one time and then at a different place at a later time. These are very different circumstances.

This figure shows these two simple interludes [notice the clocks at the top registering the initial time (transparent arrow) and the final time (solid arrow)] as we'd watch them unfold on the table's surface: at the top (a) the ball is just sitting still and top (b) its moving to the right. In (c) and (d) we see the abstracted Space Diagrams (not pictures of balls, but dots) for each interlude.

The important thing to note is the times. Above each event there's a clock and two times that have elapsed. In (b), the moving interlude, it's obvious that the time value at position $(x_0, y_0)$ is $t_0$ and the time when the ball has traveled to position $(x_1,y_0)$ is $t_1$. In (a) it's simpler, but sort of an different way of thinking. The ball is stationary but time…as they say…marches on. I've represented that on the same clock face at the top.

```{r spacevent, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Two Space Events and their corresponding Space Diagrams. (a) The ball is sitting still between the two indicated time intervals. (b) The ball is rolling from $x_0$ to $x_1$ during that time interval. In (c) and (d) the actual objects are replaced by dots and arrows that signify the events and intervals.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/spaceevent.png')
```


<br>The Space Diagram for event (d) is just exactly that line you'd draw on a map to trace out your journey. The start and the finish points are "events" for us and the space traveled and the time elapsed are "intervals" for us.

This next figure shows a different way of representing these two events.

```{r spacetime1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The same two Space Events and their consequent Spacetime Diagrams.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/spacetimeevent.png')
```

The ball-just-sitting there event in Spacetime is different…the ball in (e) is shown to be stationary in the horizontal space dimension at $x_0$, but it's "*moving*" in the time dimension and the diagram is an arrow through time. For the other event in (f), the Spacetime diagram shows the line that moves forward in time and forward in space and that's exactly what we'd done earlier. The slope of a properly drawn Spacetime diagram element is the speed of that object. Here I've drawn in a slope "calculation"…to guide the eye.

```{r spacetimedelta, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The slope of our spacetime trajectory is just the velocity of an object following that trajectory: $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = v$", dev='png', out.width = "350"}

## Back to Galileo: Acceleration{#motionaccelerationgalileo}

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Galileo's study of mechanics didn't result in a system, like Aristotles or Newton's. It was a loosely-connected collection of experiments and speculations. There were some themes, though, and they followed a rough intellectual chronology:

- pendulum
- free-fall
- uniformly accelerated motion
- unimpeded motion
- projectiles
- relativity
- materials science and the strength of materials

Free-fall and the pendulum were a part of his immature speculations in *de Motu* from Pisa but I'll cover free-fall first. Then we'll see why pendula inspired him. 

He wasn't helpful to later biographers as it's hard to figure out what he did, and when he did it. Here's a rough guess:

* Pisa: 1589-1592...maybe pendula, falling bodies, inclined plane?
* Padua: 1592-1610...certainly the pendulum, falling bodies, the inclined plane, projectiles, and relativity 
* Padua: 1608 on...his telescopic observations begin
* Florence: 1610-1634...his *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,* 1630
* Arcetri, house arrest: 1633-1642...*Discourse on Two New Sciences*, 1638

How do we know what he did? That's been the subject of nearly 400 years of Galileo Scholarship which continues today. His first biographer was his faithful student, Vincenzo Viviani (1622-1703) whose legacy is problematic as he appears to have just made up stuff. So legends began and were then slowly debunked over centuries. 

The story of his papers is right out of a bad TV movie. They were preserved by those close to him when he died and passed from Viviani, to his nephew, to a nephew of a nephew...and then they vanished when that last descendent discarded them in 1737. Then along comes Florentine nobleman Giovanni Battista Nelli, who wanted some mortadella for a picnic and upon sitting to eat discovers that the sausage had been wrapped in paper with Galileo's handwriting. He rushed back to the butcher and found that he had been wrapping meat in paper discarded by the previous owner of the building. Nelli purchased all of the scraps and made cataloging the documents and writing a massive biography of Galileo his life work. Those manuscripts are now today in the *Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence*,  *Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, Florence*, and the *Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin* and on-line at: [http://www.imss.fi.it/ms72/INDEX.HTM](http://www.imss.fi.it/ms72/INDEX.HTM) . There you can find high resolution photographs of the pages and translations of the handwritten texts. We'll see some of them in a bit.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Pisa To Padua

<aside class="myaside"><b>Galileo's Common-law wife and children</b> For a professor to remain single was not unusual and Galileo was a frequent visitor to Venice and its literary and art community. This was a sophisticated society with thousands of highly literate courtesans. While little is known about the early relationship between Galileo and Marina di Gamba, some have speculated that she might have been such a professional companion. Galileo stayed with her for almost a decade, which might suggest that they were intellectually compatible – indeed, given his personality, it would have been surprising were he to spend time with someone not up to his conversational standard.<br><br> In any case, Gamba moved to Padua to live with him where they had three children, two girls and a boy. (Birth records do not refer to a father.) When he went back to Florence in 1610, he took Livia and Virginia (aged 9 and 10) with him  but left four-year old Vincenzio with Gamba, who remained in Padua and eventually married.<br><br> He installed the girls in convents, where they would cost no dowry, and brought his son to Florence. Eventually, Vincenzo became a musician and was partially supported by the Pope, as a deference to Galileo. Virginia, later Sister Maria Celeste, relied on him for his influence in supporting her convent. She died in 1633, the year he entered house arrest as an old man. He was devastated.</aside>

Galileo's salary Pisa as a mathematics and astronomy professor was abysmally low and he was clearly ready for a more lucrative position – plus nobody in Pisa was eager to have him around. So after three years, when he was offered a job at the University of Padua at the age of 28 he took it and stayed for 18 years until 1610. Not only was his salary higher, the Venetian Republic was a much more independent region of Italy.[^italy]  Indeed, unlike Florence in Tuscany where connections to Rome and the Papacy were long-standing, Venice was often in the Papal Doghouse for its independent ways (five popes essentially excommunicated the entire city…and five popes changed their minds). Here Galileo became a popular professor; he created tools for military use that he was able to sell, including a manual. He settled into a common-law relationship with Marina and their three children. But money continued to be problematic and so he and Marina took Paduan students for tutoring and rental income into their crowded home.

[^italy]: Actually…this was before there was an "Italy."



### Free Fall: Dropping Things

Very early on Galileo recognized that the unnatural/natural motion notions of Aristotle were wrong, but he struggled to explain it. Remember, by extension his complaint is not just with Aristotle's ideas, but with the basis of all Renaissance university education and Church doctrine. Aristotle insisted that if dropped, two objects made of the same material but of different weights would not hit the ground at the same time. The heavier one would be more “eager” to go to its natural place (the earth’s center) than the light one – because it consists of more earthy matter. He explicitly linked an object's weight with the speed at which it would fall. Aristotle didn't do "quantitative" so his notion of "faster" was a proportional statement.

<aside class="myaside"> A battle has raged in the history of science community for decades about what experiments Galileo actually did (or whether he did any at all) and what experiments he just described as if he'd done them. This was compounded by the fact that Viviani clearly fictionalized some of the Galileo lore in a biography published after the great man had died. Let's be clear: Galileo did not drop big objects from the top of the <em>Leaning Tower of Pisa</em>. He described such a demonstration, but got the answer wrong. Further, nobody ever claimed to have seen him do it, including Galileo himself. In a bit we'll uncover what he said. Myth, busted.</aside> 

It was clear to everyone that the further an object fell, the longer were the spaces between roughly equal times. All one had to do was watch water dripping from a roof...near the roof, the distance between drops is shorter than near the ground. Longer distances traveled in equal times means velocities increase in equal times…that's **acceleration**. As I said, everyone knew that. But in what manner does this change in speed happen: some said, as proportional to the distance ($v \propto x$) while others said as a function of the time ($v \propto t$). Inquiring minds wanted to know! And many tried. (Including one of Galileo's Philosophy professors who threw stuff out of the upper story of his home in Pisa.)

Galileo first started to think differently about motion when he was a professor at Pisa. That’s where he was supposed to have dropped a wooden and iron ball from the *Leaning Tower*, although we know that he couldn’t have done it the way he described it. His first, unpublished pamphlet on motion was a mixture of an old language and his attempts at a new one, and so was not quite there yet.

While Galileo was in Padua, he began his experiments with moving objects. His original ideas were unformed, but he reworked them as he further shed his Aristotelian influences. He had a workshop at his home and eventually hired a toolmaker. But he was striking out in a new direction: he planned to measure how things fell quantitatively and as a function of time.

Galileo determined to get to the bottom of falling (hee hee), and he wasn't the first. Some linked the speed of a falling object with its density. Others, like Leonardo da Vinci, speculated from some fanciful geometry that an object would fall a particular distance in relation to the time interval. The figure below shows this. The left shows the distance that an object would fall in successive, equal time intervals as da Vinci imagined it. In the first unit of time---think, say a second, the object would fall 1 unit of distance. In the second unit of time, it would then fall 2 units of distance, in the third, three...and so on. That's indeed an accelerating object, but it's not a *constant acceleration*.

```{r freefallGdV, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="In this corner, Leonardo daVinci's model of free-fall. And the challenger, Galileo Galilei's model of free-fall. The left group shows a ruler with equal markings and bold marks where a falling ball would be after the equal time intervals on the left---as described by daVinci. On the right is Galileo's results. The arrows are described in the text.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/freefallGdV.png')
```

There was another suggestion that came from a geometrical analysis in the 1300s: if the acceleration in free-fall were constant,  then in each successive unit of time the distance of an object would increase according to the _odd integers_!

<!--- Mean rule--->
<!-- back to normal -------------->

<!--So, in time intervals 1, 2, 3 seconds, the distance fallen would have values 1, 3, 5 units.  This is shown on the right side of the figure.  Look at the lines drawn in on the right of this figure. Notice that the first interval of time leads to 1 unit of fallen distance. The second interval is 3 units (remember, the odd integers), the fourth...of course, 5 units. Now add them up for the total distance fallen as time increases: the first unit of time, 1. The second unit of time $1+3=4$. The third unit of time, $1+3+5=9$, and so on. 1, 4, 9... are the perfect squares of the time intervals, 1, 2, 3...--> 

So the end result is if one sees falling objects that increased their total distance by the perfect squares that would guarantee evidence of a constant acceleration.

> **Wait.** Why didn’t someone just measure it two centuries before?  <br>**Glad you asked.** First, the idea of an experiment had just not caught on very much. One thought about things, consulted Aristotle, and argued. Not much tinkering. <br>But also things fall fast! Even in the early seventeenth century precision time-keeping really didn't exist. 

Galileo was near Venice, home of one of the oldest and most celebrated striking-clocks in history, but to measure times as fast as those of a falling body? Not possible. But this guy was clever.

#### An Aside: What Did He Know And When Did He Know It?

It's not a secret that Galileo got it right. The question is how and when. We now know: 

* if one finds that the velocity of an object is proportional to the distance, then the acceleration is not constant. $v \propto x$ means that $x \propto e^t$. 
* if one finds that the velocity of an object is proportional to time, then the acceleration is constant and the distance increases as the square of the time. $v\propto t$ means that $x \propto t^2$.

In fact, in 1604 in a letter to Paulo Sarpi, a colleague in Venice he concluded that 
$$
v \propto x \nonumber
$$
which is wrong. And then soon after that he claimed that he'd found that 
$$
x \propto t^2 \nonumber
$$
which is mathematically impossible from his previous assumption. So what happened? There are multiple interpretations. The story that most believe is that he did the experiment I'll describe next sometime before 1604 and was able to determined that the $t^2$. He must have tried to relate the two conclusions, but his tools were not sufficient. Remarkably, Galileo used only proportions and geometry and his deductions and manipulations are tortured and nearly impossible to follow today. Let's see what he did and we'll assume that his experiments drove his conclusions.

He didn't write up his mechanics until he was blind and under house arrest, so that obviously has complicated the chronology. But he was clear by that time what he'd done more nearly 40 years before:

> "And thus, it seems, we shall not be far wrong if we put the increment of speed as proportional to the increment of time; hence the definition of motion which we are about to discuss may be stated as follows: A motion is said to be uniformly accelerated, when starting from rest, it acquires, during equal time-intervals, equal increments of speed." Third Day of  <u>Two New Sciences</u> 1641

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### What Did He Do?

Our conclusion is that Galileo tricked nature around 1604 and  found a way to dilute gravity so that he could make timing measurements using contemporary tools. Instead of dropping a ball, he let it roll down a gentle incline. He reasoned that whatever pull a ball felt in free-fall would still govern the reduced acceleration in a slow descent down an incline: inclines of only two or three degrees were ideal. The figure below shows his setup and his results.

```{r galileoPlane, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="A ball \"falling\" down an incline.", dev='png', out.width = "650"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/galileoPlane.png')
```

<video width="500" poster="./images/motion/galileo_incline.png" controls>
  <source src="./images/motion/galileo_incline.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

Galileo was good with his hands, and appreciating that he needed to reduce the effects of friction and other extra impediments to determining the real rules, he built inclines with finely machined grooves to minimize the effects of friction and then made elaborate schemes to measure the time that it took for an object to "fall" as it rolled slowly down. He needed a clock, so he used his pulse. When that wasn’t sufficiently regular, he hired a string quartet to play at an even meter. He eventually invented a "water clock" that slowly dripped at a regular rate and it was with that, he was able to see how far a ball would roll during each “tick” of his water clock, or by measuring the volume of accumulated water for different intervals.

How do we know that this was a real measurement and not some thought-experiment? Because he told us. Galileo kept careful records of his experiments and these have been preserved as I described.

This amazing figure

```{r galileoNotes, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Galileo's notebook from 1604. His work has been digitized, translated, and annotated. This page is from [folio107](http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Galileo_Prototype/HTML/F107_V/F107_V.HTM)", dev='png', out.width = "550"}

```

shows the aha! moment in one of his pages where he’s taking his measurements, scribbling around the sheet, and keeping his records in the upper left hand corner. The preeminent Galileo scholar, the late Stillman Drake from the University of Minnesota studied these notebooks and found something intriguing.  Notice that the numbers 1 through 8 are clearly visible in the middle column in the inset. The numbers on the right are the distances he measured down the plane, and are a result of some of the arithmetic on the sheet. But the numbers in the left-hand column? Drake noticed on this particular page that the ink used in the left column was different from the ink in the actual data-taking on that page. In fact that ink was consistent with pages that came from entries many days later. Look carefully at those numbers...they are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64.

>**a most important moment **<br><br>
>The presumption is that Galileo took the data, pondered the results, and then later realized that his measurements fit the time-squared rule and came back later to the page to add them in. Imagine what his emotional state must have been when he realized what he’d done! He'd **demonstrated** that the acceleration of a falling body is constant. **I think this is one of the most important documents in the history of science.**

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Little $g$ {#motionlittleg}

Let's do what we almost always do when confronted with data: plot it. I can just make out the numbers in his manuscript. The units for both time and distance are a little unusual, so we'll leave them without dimensions.

```{r galileoPlot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Galileo's data plotted in modern times.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/galileoPlot.png')
```

This is a familiar shape and the squares in the data above give us the clue that this is the shape of a parabola, and it's a pretty good one. The curve is not drawn through the points, but rather is a fit to the functional form of a parabola. So we could write the equation of this curve as

$$x(t)=\text{constant  }\times t^2$$

The constant comes from measurement and in modern units we write:

$$x = \cfrac{1}{2}gt^2$$

where we give this special, constant acceleration a name, the “**acceleration of gravity**,” $g$, or “little g,” which is roughly 32 ft/sec/sec, or 9.8 m/s$^2$. This was first measured by Isaac Newton a generation later using very long pendulums.

>**little g **<br><br>
>Objects near the earth's surface fall with essentially constant acceleration of $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$, or $g=32$ ft/s$^2$.


We can summarize his results in a series of plots which represent this model of falling objects. Little $g$'s value of 9.8 m/s$^2$ is so close to 10 m/s$^2$, that we can often get away with that rounded value. The following plots do just that.

First, the velocity changes linearly with time if the acceleration is constant---here, that lazy 10  m/s$^2$ .

```{r galileovt, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The velocity versus time for a constant acceleration of 10  m/s$^2$ for a large time spread (left) and a narrow time spread (right).", dev='png', out.width = "800"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/galileo_v_t.png')
```

Here is the quadratic distance-time relationship stemming from that constant acceleration:

```{r galileoxt, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The distance versus time for a constant acceleration of 10  m/s$^2$ for a large time spread (left) and a narrow time spread (right).", dev='png', out.width = "800"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/galileo_x_t.png')
```

We could combine the equations for constant acceleration and eliminate the time coordinate to get a relationship between the speed and the distance fallen. Here is that:

```{r galileovx, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The velocity versus distance for a constant acceleration of 10  m/s$^2$ for a large distance spread (left) and a narrow distance spread (right).", dev='png', out.width = "800"}

This is not the complete story…see the section below about air resistance.

<!--He then made yet another important leap: In practice, a heavier object would hit the ground slightly before a lighter one, but he correctly reasoned that this was because the effect of the resistance of the air would be a larger retarding force on the little ball than on the heavier one. How did he come to that conclusion? Two ways.-->

<!--First, he out-Aristotled Aristotle by arguing logically. Suppose you took two objects, one more massive than the other, and tied them together. A strict interpretation of Aristotle would say that the lighter object would retard the motion of the pair since it would have more of the property of "lightness." But the same reading of The Philosopher would argue that the heavier one would make the pair go faster. You can't have it both ways and so Galileo reasoned that Aristotle's argument was logically inconsistent.-->

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## The Equations of Constant Acceleration {#motioneqacceleration}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Some of the graphical representations of motion had their origins with Galileo, but their algebraic form waited for the 17th and 18th centuries to become standard practice. We'll make light use of 4 formulas  for constantly accelerated motion that relate: $x$ (or actually, $x-x_0 = \Delta x$), $t$ (which is really the interval, $t-t_0 = \Delta t$ but with the start time as $t_0=0$), $v_0$ (the initial velocity), $v$ (the final velocity), and $a$ (the acceleration).

$$\begin{align}
& \text{1. } \; x = \langle v \rangle t (\#eq:avev) \\ 
& \text{2.  } \; v   = v_0 + at (\#eq:vat) \\
& \text{3. }  \; x   = x_0+v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2 (\#eq:xat)  \\
& \text{4. }\; v^2   = v_0^2 + 2ax (\#eq:vax) 
\end{align}$$

We've not worked out the fourth equation \@ref(eq:vax), but it comes from an algebraic elimination of time between the first and third relations. The curves above originally came from these formulae for the particular acceleration,  $a \to g=10$ m/s$^2$.

<!--- EXAMPLE --->
</div>
<!-- back to normal -------------->

While we owe Galileo for the acceleration due to gravity on earth, his conclusions work for any constantly accelerated object, not just falling. So we would use the general acceleration, $a$ and when we’re dealing with things falling near the Earth, we’d use the specific acceleration. 

Let’s work out what the acceleration would be for cars that you may or may not drive.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## Acceleration, In Everyday Terms {#motionaccelerationmodern}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

So far we've treated acceleration descriptively: it's when velocity increases (or decreases) over time. Let's put this on a more firm footing by defining acceleration as a rate just like we defined velocity:

<!-- write it --------------------->
<div class="penout">🖋 📓

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v-v_0}{t-t_0}.\label{acceleration}$$

This is another quantity that you're well acquainted with…after all, the pedal by your right foot is the "accelerator." In that spirit remember that a standard measure of manliness is ownership of a muscle-car capable of  "0 to 60" (mph) in a short period of time: the everyday epitome of an acceleration, from one speed (0) to another speed (60 mph). The units are little odd, as maybe you noticed with $g$. Let's race.

If you own, say, a Mitsubishi Mirage ES, it will take you around 12 seconds to get to sixty from rest. If you own a Porsche 911 Carrera S, it will take you closer to 4 seconds. From our definition we can quote the acceleration of the Mitsubishi as

$$\begin{align}a &=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \nonumber \\ &=\frac{60 \text{ mph}-0\text{ mph}}{12\text{ seconds}-0\text{ seconds}} \nonumber \\ &=5 \text{ mph per second} \nonumber \nonumber \end{align}$$

That odd double time unit, miles per hour per second, shows you that this is a rate...of speed change. If you start from a standing start in your Mitsubishi then after 1 second you will have reached 5 mph and after 2 seconds, 10 mph. Every second, your speed will increase by 5 mph.

While this "mph per second" unit makes it plain, it's not what we would usually say. In physics, we'd convert to a single unit of time and then square it. I'll do this once and then we'll use Mr. Google for unit-conversion in order to convert from one unit to another without the drudgery of forming all of those ratios.

Let’s convert 5 mph into miles per second: <br>

$$\begin{align} X \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{second}} &= 5 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ min}} \times \frac{1 \text{ min}}{60 \text{ sec}}  \nonumber \\
&= 5 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{second}}\times \frac{1}{3600} \nonumber \\
&=1.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{miles/s} \nonumber
\end{align}$$

So our acceleration is $1.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{miles/s}^2$ <br>

</div>
<!-- back to normal -------------->

> **Wait.** I don’t have any idea what that number means in my life! <br>
> **Glad you asked.** Neither do I. It’s an acceleration which isn’t one of our normal everyday units (even though we speed up and slow down all the time while walking and driving). But one acceleration we do have a feel for is that of gravity, so let’s compare it to little gee, $g$.

This doesn't exactly press you to the back of your seat. You know how I know that? Because we can further convert it to something that we can compare with falling. That is, compare it to little $g$ which we know to be about $10$ m/s$^2$. So let’s get the miles per second into meters per second and we’ll just a little engine to do that. 

We know:

* our acceleration is $1.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{miles/s/s}$
* we can change the miles into meters and we’d then have that acceleration in meters per second per second

We find that our unenlightened Mitsubishi acceleration of  $1.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{miles/s}^2$ converts to $2.2$ m/s$^2$. One more step to get it into something we can compare with life.

>**pulling gees ** <br><br>
>Acceleration at a rate of $g$ is called…well, “gees.” And “pulling gees” is a measure of acceleration that fighter pilots (and NASCAR drivers) must contend with: In order to not black out, humans can tolerate accelerations up to around 6 $g$’s, or accelerations of $6 \times 9.8$ m/s$^2=$  about 60 m/s$^2.$ That’s moving right along as you will see from the Porsche-experience below.

Remembering that $g=32 \text { ft/s}^2 = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$ we realize that flooring the little Mitsubishi isn't exactly like falling off a log...or falling off of anything for that matter, since it’s more than 4 times less acceleration than falling off that log at $g$ (9.8/2.2 = 4.4) .  

If you black out while speeding up in your Mitsubishi, it’s not because of acceleration.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## Special Kinds of Acceleration {#motionspecialkinds}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now we can categorize acceleration into three separate categories.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Zero Acceleration

No acceleration indicates that an object maintains a constant velocity.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Positive and Negative Acceleration

Positive and Negative accelerations mean very different things here and we’ll illustrate this with a simple pair of examples. When you leave the city limits, your speed goes from 35 mph to 55 mph, so the numerator in the definition of acceleration in Eq. \eqref{acceleration} $$\Delta v = v - v_0 = 55 - 35 = +20 \text{ mph}$$ and this would be a positive acceleration (when you divide by the time it takes), or just “accelerating.” 

But when you come into town from the highway, your speed goes from 55 mph to 35 mph and the numerator in the acceleration equation $$\Delta v = 35 -50 = -20 \text{ mph}$$ would be a *negative* acceleration, which is called a *deceleration*. So acceleration is negative or positive by virtue of whether the object is slowing down or speeding up.

Let's look at a deceleration, plus we'll include an initial velocity. On the water.

<!-- <!-- back to normal -------------->

This example shows that it's hard to stop an aircraft carrier and that the acceleration to do so will be negative. That makes sense, right? It would be negative, since it's decelerating. It's a tiny deceleration because it takes so long for it to stop (which is in turn because an aircraft carrier is a really heavy thing!).

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Varying Acceleration

When you accelerate in your car, you probably press on the accelerator pedal more and more. If you held it constant and ignored wind resistance, you'd accelerate at a constant rate. But if you press harder and harder, you're varying the acceleration...a non-constant acceleration. This is a more complex problem mathematically, so we'll not go there. But it's  a very common occurrence.

Cars are not the only place where we encounter non-constant accelerated motion. How about running? A sprinter comes out of the blocks with a very high change of speed, and so a very high acceleration. As she gets into her stride and become more erect, her effort must fight against wind resistance and besides, her internal quick expenditure of energy would be hard to maintain, so there’s a *reduction* of acceleration. Note this doesn’t mean a reduction in velocity, just that the velocity increases at a slower rate as the race goes on. Nor does it mean a deceleration, rather she’s still going faster, just at a lesser rate than before.

knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/madden.png')
```

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## The Pendulum {#motionpendulum}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

A pendulum is a trivial toy, yet it uses many key ideas about motion and force. Galileo, Christiaan Huygens (whom we’ll meet in a bit), and Isaac Newton each made many pendulums and did extensive experiments with them. Because of its immediate simplicity, quantitative measurements are easily done with modest tools. This figure is a picture of a simple pendulum which I’ll refer to periodically over the next few chapters.

```{r pendulum, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Each picture is referred to in the text. Think of the red dot as a peg, either from where the pendulum cord is attached—all of the figures—or in (c) where a peg suddenly gets in the way.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/pendulum.png')
```


Buzzword: a "**period**."

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The period is the time that it takes for some repetitive motion to repeat. </p>

These are all observations that Galileo made about pendulums in 1602. 

* In (a) the little pendulum bob makes a to-and-fro motion from A to B and then back to A and the same thing happens in figure (b). Galileo found that the time to complete a full period (from A-B-A, and from C-D-C) was the same for (a) as it was for (b).[^pend]  This is called the isochronous (equal time) behavior of pendulums.[^aOrum] It doesn't matter how far up you start the pendulum, the time it takes is the same for all. In fact, he found that the period of a pendulum depends only on the length of the cord.

[^aOrum]: So is it pendulums or pendula? My Latin teacher would say the second, but standard usage accepts the former. We'll be standard. Besides, I didn't especially like my Latin teacher.

[^pend]: This is strictly true for only small angles which was not understood for 50 years.

* The next thing that he found was close, but not quite the case, but here he was again, very clever. Look at (b) which has some additional markings. In the drawing the height that the bob starts from at C, $y_C$, is the same as the height that the pendulum goes to at D, namely $y_C=y_D$. Furthermore, this common height is regained, back and forth as the pendulum repeats its motion. Except it doesn’t!

Real pendulums don't do this – they slow down. Galileo acknowledged this observation. But instead of believing that every pendulum swing for different bobs to be unique, he claimed that there was an unchanging – and unobservable – rule of motion (a "law") that's masked by friction and air resistance. 

This is an example of the most important idea that Galileo left for us, even more important than some of his discovered facts about Nature:

>**the real-rules of nature are hidden ** <br><br>
>Galileo decided that the regularities of Nature were ideal and hidden from actual behavior. We can get close, but not exactly there. An ideal pendulum would repeat forever, always coming back to those original heights and it's friction in the pin and air resistance that modify that perfect behavior. **The goal of natural philosophy (our "science") is not to describe what we observe in real life, but rather to uncover those hidden regularities** and then explain the corrupted behavior that we observe as due to small influences like friction. Without this new motivation, physics is impossible.


* Galileo studied this return-to-the-source phenomenon by sticking a peg in the way of the string causing the bob to quickly rise...back to that same level, as shown in figure (c).

* Finally, here's one more important discovery. Figures (d) and (e) are meant to represent the comparison of two pendulums for which the bobs are different masses and/or different materials. Through experiment he found that they behave identically. Nature doesn't care if the big pendulum bob is iron and the other is wood: the bobs have the same periods and behave the same regardless of their nature.

Galileo found that the period depends only on the length of the cord. Newton went further and measured $g$ using pendulums, deriving the period mathematically from his mechanics.

>We've just crossed an important historical milestone. Physics is now possible because of this crucial discovery by Galileo: there are fundamental rules that nature follows, common for all processes, but hidden from our observations by disruptive effects like friction and air resistance. 

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The physicist's job is to find these hidden, universal rules by conceptual and mathematical modeling. 
 </p>

Everything that follows in this book is built on this commitment!

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Back to falling bodies

It's this extrapolation from pendulum motion to falling bodies that led Galileo to decide that a falling body accelerates the same regardless of its size, material, or weight.

There are two really important ideas here. First, as I emphasized he's assuming that the true rules of motion are ideal and hidden from us in real life. Second, he explains the observational fact that a heavier object when dropped _will_ fall to the ground faster than a light object. Your eyes deceive you!  He surmised that the lighter object is much more affected by air resistance than a heavier one. Even if two objects were made of the same material, but were different shapes---they should land at the same time, but in real life the air would slow down the larger of the two. This is pendulum-thinking! Galileo saw a connection between one phenomenon (pendulum periodic motion) and a seemingly different phenomenon (free fall) and used one to gain insight into the other. To Aristotle, one would be unnatural motion and the other natural, so this is a big leap.

<aside class="myaside">You can test this yourself. Take two identical pieces of paper, crumple one up into a ball and drop them both. What happens?</aside>

Never in his life did he---nor have you or I---seen two different objects fall in the presence of gravity in exactly the way that Galileo insisted was the underlying rule. Humankind had to go to the Moon in order to test this in the complete absence of any air:

<figure>
<div style="text-align:center"><video width="100%" controls>

  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video></div>
</figure><br>

*In 1971 towards the end of his last moon-walk, Commander David Scott dropped a hammer and a feather in order to demonstrate (test?) Galileo's assertion about free-fall. Scott was an engineering student at the University of Michigan for one year (and was on the swim team) when he transferred to West Point. He graduated with such high grades that he was able to pick which service to join and chose the Air Force where he became a test pilot. Apollo 15 was the fourth moon landing and Scott's third space mission.*<br><br>

*But wait, there's more.* In an ingenuous blending of pendulum and inclined plane motion, Galileo discovered Newton's First Law of Motion, 60 years before Newton did. This figure tells that story:

```{r forever, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Galileo's reasoning about how an object would move forever---an early version of the law of inertia.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/forever.png')
```

In the top figure, a ball rolling down an inclined plane gets to the bottom and rolls up the adjacent plane to B which is at the same height as A. See how that's very close in spirit to a pendulum? In the next figure the second plane is shallower, but the ball still makes it back to its new B...which is at the same height. The next figure, the same thing happens. Galileo then says what if the adjacent incline is not an incline at all, but just a flat surface---his conclusion was that the ball would continue in a straight line forever. [^forever]

[^forever]: Actually, here he was confused. His "straight line" would have followed the curvature of the earth's surface. So not Newton's "straight line."

Again this conclusion is totally contra-Aristotle! There's no pushing involved in this final motion. Once it’s started, it goes. 

> Notice how far behind Aristotle looks in Galileo’s rear view mirror! 

He’s not worried about natural or unnatural motion and he’s not concerned himself with _why_ the motion continues. Rather he’s asking different questions...*How* questions rather than *Why* questions. Aristotle’s students would start with a philosophical prejudice and interpret what they saw in accordance with that philosophical system. Why did something in Nature happen? Aristotle's writings would provide the answer, regardless of the contortions required to make it fit. The authority of Aristotle functioned much like legal precedent functions in a courtroom: you explain according to textual authority. Nope. Not our Galileo, not in our science.

Galileo threw all of that aside and observed nature with fewer (albeit, different) preconceived notions than people before him.  So if you release a ball in any of our three examples---free fall, pendulum, and inclined planes---*where would it go?* is his question. Not, *why* would it go. He’d set up the circumstance and he'd observe it---no Aristotelian would do an experiment. They would think about it in the specific context of the philosophy and passively observe.


<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Now he’s doing physics and Aristotle has left the building. </p>


<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Air Resistance

Little $g$ is a large acceleration, but raindrops don’t usually bruise us and hail stones don’t usually kill. in the absence of air resistance, nice spring showers would be dangerous as rain drops fall a long way! It turns out that things dropped from high up reach a speed in which the viscous drag of air friction pushes back with the same force that the Earth pulls, causing a falling object to reach equilibrium. The result is that the speed of falling becomes constant to what’s now called the Terminal Velocity, which depends on an object’s size.

For example, a regulation major league baseball will reach terminal velocity in about two and a half seconds after falling about 100 ft. At that point, its speed will be just a little more than 60 mph and will stay at that value. For reference, the “Green Monster” left field wall in Fenway Park is about 40 feet (11 m) high, so you can see that high fly balls would be high enough to reach terminal velocity on their way down.

<aside class="myaside">There have been stunts performed with baseballs dropped from the Washington Monument, skyscrapers, and balloons for players to catch. The speed that a baseball would achieve is not much more than that experienced by a catcher on a high school baseball team. However, famously a professional catcher knocked himself out missing a ball dropped from a blimp.</aside>
While Galileo was on the faculty at Padua, he did other experiments with motion which lay dormant until 1638 when he wrote the second of his great books, _Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences_. He finished this work while under house arrest outside of Florence as an old, sick man. How he got into trouble is a story that we’ll leave for our discussion of early astronomy.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### That Tower

```{r tower_painting, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Luigi Catani, 1816 (Palazzo Pitti, Firenze, Quartiere Borbonico o Nuovo Palatino, sala 15)", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/tower_painting.png')
```

You know the one. That story. Galileo did write about dropping two cannon balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and he described what one would see: the lighter of the two would lag the heavier. Not simultaneous. He'd seen things fall and realized that the density of the ball compared with the density of air would favor the more dense object. But he was committed to the program and explained the lack of simultaneity was *due to the environment.* The rule of free fall was still valid as an abstraction. Here's what Galileo said:

> "Aristotle says that 'an iron ball of one hundred pounds falling from a height of one hundred cubits reaches the ground before a one-pound ball has fallen a single cubit.' I say that they arrive at the same time. You find, on making the experiment, that the larger outstrips the smaller by two finger-breadths, that is, when the larger has reached the ground, the other is short of it by two finger-breadths."

One hundred cubits is about 200 feet. The Leaning Tower is 58 meters high, or about 190 feet, so roughly 100 cubits.

Galileo was right to scorn the enormous difference in distance fallen predicted by Aristotle but his own prediction is way off!

That "two finger breadths" would be only a couple of inches at most. However, if one uses a model of air and iron and calculates the effect of the retardation of each by the medium, you find that the lighter would lag the heavier by about 4 feet! So he didn't perform the experiment since he could easily have observed that separation. Many have since, confirming the calculations. 

Also one would have thought that such a demonstration would have been a big deal "on campus" and Pisa would have been all abuzz. Certainly there are lots of painted depictions of the event. But there is no correspondence, no public announcement or public report...silence. This is another of the myths created by Galileo's imaginative student, Viviani. The experiment at the tower and elsewhere was performed by others, including: Vicenzio Renieri, Giorgio Coresio, Simon Stevin, Giuseppe Moletti, Varchi, and John Philoponus. Renieri was a professor and priest and reported the results (apparently badly) to Galileo. Maybe that's where he got the idea.

In the absence of air resistance, a cannonball – or an apple – would fall the 58 meters to a speed of about 33 m/s, about 70 mph. And now you know how to calculate that.

## Going In the Right Direction! {#motionvector}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now we need to add one more piece to the modern story. As we saw in the Mathematics review lesson, distances---displacements---are vector quantities. Because distance is in the definition of velocity, and since distance is a vector, so is velocity. Since velocity is a vector and acceleration is defined in terms of it? Yes, acceleration is a vector too.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Velocity Is a Vector

Here’s our first physics-vector. I’ve been loose with the words speed and velocity. In fact, there’s a difference: velocity is a vector, $\vec{v}$, and so it includes a magnitude and a direction, and the magnitude of velocity is the speed. Now the definition of velocity should really be:

$$\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}$$

implicitly included distance ($\vec{x}$) as a vector quantity, but not time. North and east are different directions and $\vec{x}$ makes that clear. Like mass, temperature, and many other quantities, time is not a vector. At least, not yet!

Likewise, 60 mph east is not the same velocity as 60 mph north, but the speeds are the same---your speedometer would report the same speed for both trips.  Certainly if you’re trying to go north, you don’t want to deploy a *velocity* that points east. So both the magnitude (speed, here) and the direction are required to specify a velocity. We simply draw an arrow (on a paper, or map), the direction of which points in the direction of travel and the length of which is defined by some scale of speed magnitudes.


Now when you’re out walking I want for you to invent your own speed scale---how many inches equals 1 mph of walking speed---and then imagine this arrow sticking out of your chest. As you speed up, the arrow gets longer and as you slow down, the arrow shrinks. If you turn left, the arrow turns with you. Everywhere you go, you imagine your very own velocity arrow preceding you, pointing the way. You should also imagine arrows coming out of everyone you see, people on bicycles would have longer arrows and cars would have even longer ones. When they come to a stop sign? The arrow shrinks as you decelerate and blinks out of sight. Keep this in mind as we move on to those length-changing arrows.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### Acceleration Is a Vector

Since velocity is a vector and acceleration is defined in terms of velocity, it too is a vector:

$$\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}.$$

While the little arrow that represents your personal velocity always points out in front of you, its direction seems rather arbitrary. It goes where you go, but there’s nothing special about the direction. But that’s not really the case since our movement is inside of a coordinate system of streets, sidewalks, hallways, etc. and they all have relative directions and we could describe our velocity in terms of them. So, "60 mph east" would be a perfectly good vector description of speeding towards Detroit from East Lansing. Likewise, if we defined a vector of unit-length ($\mathbf{i}$) that points in the east direction and call that the $x$ axis, that same velocity could be written as $\mathbf{v}=60\, \mathbf{i}$ mph. The pretty subject of vector analysis is built this way, but in QS&BB we won't use that notation. We'll be relaxed and laid-back about most vectors. 

In that spirit let's choose to define our coordinate system such east is the positive direction and west, a negative direction. If you’re walking east, then you could say your velocity is 2 mph, east, or you could say that your velocity is $+2$ mph E. If you’re walking to the west, your velocity would be $-2$ mph E or $+2$ mph W (but usually we assign a positive direction and stick with it…East, to the right, is standard). The direction and the sign are mingled. Because we will work in one dimension most of the time, this dual-role for a sign will matter but hopefully be pretty easy and we will almost always be able to say: east is the $x$ axis and so our velocities above are $+2$ or $-2$, with the sign implying the direction of positive $x$ is east.

<div class="penout">🖋 📓

This is important as we consider the direction of an acceleration. Suppose your speed is 60 mph and after a certain time---let’s say 2 hours---your speed has increased to 70 mph. Remembering our ordering in the $\Delta$ notation of (now minus before), then  the magnitude of your acceleration would be:

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{70-60}{2} = 5 \text{ miles per hour}^2.$$

Now what if your original speed is reduced because you applied the brakes from 70 mph to 50 mph. Then we’d have:

$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{50-70}{2} = -10 \text{ miles per hour}^2.$$

What are we to make of that negative sign? Of course it means we’re slowing down, and we learned that the term for that is deceleration. But that pesky sign change between accelerate and decelerate is again related to our coordinate system.

This figure lays out the circumstances for constant acceleration, including zero acceleration.

```{r bugA, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="A car is shown for two events with the right column later in time than the left. In (a) the car moves at constant velocity; in (b), the car accelerates at a constant acceleration; and in (c), the car decelerates.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/bugA.png')
```

Of course the two vectors for velocity and acceleration would each refer to their own scales. At a constant speed, the velocity vectors are identical at the two times and the acceleration vector has zero length. As the car accelerates, the velocity vector gets longer. As the car decelerates, it's still going to the right, but its velocity vector gets shorter. The acceleration vector points the other way, so deceleration vectors point in the opposite direction as the velocity vectors.

I defy you now to not see arrows coming out of everything around you that moves. Welcome to my world.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### What Goes Up, Must Come Down

Armed with Galileo’s discovery and our notion of vectors, the acceleration felt by all falling objects near the Earth is constant, we can look at some examples. Let’s drop something from the Leaning Tower, in honor of fictional accounts of famous scientists. Like an apple. After all, Galileo showed that the kind of fruit — or cannonball — didn’t matter. We’ll stick with an apple.

Mr. Google tells me that the height of the Leaning Tower is 183 ft. By now, you know how to convert that to meters and it’s 57 m. Let’s ignore air resistance for a moment and look at the figures in Section 5.3 above for distance versus time and velocity versus time for an acceleration of $g=10$m/s$^2$.

Let’s make contact with real life: how quickly does the apple take to hit the ground and how fast is it going in m/s? How fast in mph?

## Projectiles {#motionprojectiles}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Throwing things was hard to understand. 

>**Projectiles, Aristotle’s way ** <br><br>
>Where Aristotle got himself into big trouble was with projectiles, like a thrown spear. His philosophical system came before explanation so he had to do an embarrassing dance to explain that when a rock was thrown the continuous “push” that he insisted was needed came from the displaced air rushing around behind the rock and pushing it forwards. Seriously. Everyone knew that this was nonsense. How can you throw a pointed spear sharp end first and then blunt end first? His authority was absolute, and organization of the first medieval universities with Philosophers and Theologians at the top guaranteed that natural science was taught by them.  Mathematicians and astronomers had supporting roles that were aimed at more mundane activities like casting horoscopes and designing military weaponry and fortifications.

Although we’ve been dealing with 1-dimensional motion, Galileo wasn’t done when he figured out that everything falls at the same, constant acceleration of gravity. He also tackled the other problem that Aristotle messed up: throwing something. With an understanding that objects would happily move at a constant speed without being pushed (his two inclined planes) and that objects fall towards Earth with a common acceleration, he had the genius idea to embed these two different motions together into the motion of a single, thrown object. Let’s follow his experiment by looking at his notes in the figure below.

> This was first considered by him when he was on his way to Padua from Pisa. He stopped in Urbino along the way to visit his friend and supporter, Guidobaldo del Monte. Remember, it was he who recommended the 26 year old Galileo to his brother, the Cardinal which induced his Pisan position. Del Monte was a mathematician and natural scientist and together they played with rolling balls across an incline. Imagine taking a plank of plywood and propping it up a few inches on one side along the ground. Now take a ball and cover it with paint and roll it up the incline at an angle. It would leave a mark from the paint and trace out...a parabola as it goes up and comes back down. Just who's idea that was...is one of those things left to the darkness of history. But parabolas were on Galileo's mind when he took it further and more seriously later.

What you see are various measurements of rolling a ball off the surface of a table and marking where it lands according to how fast it was going. How did he repeat measurements so that each attempt would be the same speed upon lift-off? He rolled them from an inclined plane where he could dial-up the speed he wanted by how far up the plane he let go of the ball as shown in this figure, again from Galileo's notes:

```{r drake2, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Galileo's notebook in which he studied the shape of the trajectory of a projectile starting with a horizontal velocity.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/drake2.png')
```

```{r tag, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="A cartoon showing Galileo's method. He released a ball at the same height on an inclined plane every time, thereby insuring that when it reached the bottom at B it would have the same velocity for every trial. The velocity at C is then controlled and the point of impact, D, was tallied for many trials.", dev='png', out.width = "550"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/motion/table.png')
```


Clever, no? So let’s think like he did. If the speed of the ball at B is $v_x$, then what’s the speed of the ball just at the edge of the table, C? It would be the same, which we’ll call $v_x$. Now when the ball flies off into space it acquires two separate motions that are combined: the ball *continues* to have the unchanged horizontal speed, $v_x$. But as it falls, it starts to acquire a *new vertical motion*, because it's now accelerated down at a rate of $g$. The two motions are separate, but together! So throughout the trajectory, the ball’s *horizontal speed remains* $v_x$. Nothing has happened to change that. The ball’s *vertical speed increases* as the ball “falls" along this curved path.

Now here’s the neat thing. Suppose at the same point where the ball leaves the table, another ball is allowed to just drop from that point, say at point C in the  figure above so that it falls (only under the influence of gravity!) to point E. This one has only one kind of motion, vertical and accelerated. But it’s accelerated by the same amount as the first one and from the same vertical height, at the same time. So which one reaches the floor first? They both reach the floor at the same time.

This bundling up of two separate motions into one object was inspired reasoning. Nobody had ever conceived of that sort of thing. By analyzing the landing point and some sophisticated solid geometry,  he was able to extrapolate to perfect conditions and assert that the trajectory that the ball – any projectile, a cannonball, a spear, an arrow – followed was that of a parabola.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
## The Beginning of Physics {#motionbeginningphysics}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

When Galileo reached the conclusion that all objects fall to Earth with the same acceleration, he was going against what he — and Aristotle, and everyone else — actually observed. Let's review the number of Galilean ideas that we've encountered…all of which were overthrows of the Aristotelean – and hence Catholic – dogma. 

- To understand nature one must do experiments. 
- To understand nature, one may not defer to authority, like the Bible or Aristotle's writings.
- For a pendulum: the period of two pendulums of the same length, but started at different heights will have the same period.
- For a pendulum: the period of two pendulums of the same length, but different materials will have the same period.
- For a pendulum: the period of two pendulums of the same length, but different masses will have the same period.
- In free-fall: two objects of different sizes but of the same material would reach the ground at the same time.
- In free-fall: two objects of the same size but of the different mass would reach the ground at the same time.
- An object already moving in a horizontal direction will never stop and will not require an active pusher.
- Any object, regardless of material or mass, if thrown as a projectile will execute a parabolic path and will not require an active pusher.
- A whole bunch of astronomical observations and conclusions that we'll talk about later!

Each of these requires that there is no resistive medium affecting the motions. **So each is a discovery that cannot be shown to be absolutely the case on earth.** Yet each is a statement reflecting what we now know are fully-trustworthy rules about nature.

Let's visit the Matrix.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### The Red Pill, or the Blue Pill?

This is very un-Aristotle. First of all, Aristotle would never have countenanced doing experiments. You can look at Nature, but don’t touch. But Galileo was all about constructing experiments and making quantitative measurements of what he observed. This was largely new and recognizably “modern.” But there’s more. To him Nature’s rules are hidden to us. We can get close to them by reducing marginal effects like friction but then we have to extrapolate from what we see in our rough and ready laboratory to the hidden rules of a more perfect world. The pendulum bob gets close when it swings back, but the actual rule driving the motion would instruct the pendulum bob to come all the way back to the original height. That’s what’s real.

**I cannot over-emphasize how important this is.** This is very much Plato’s view of nature, not Aristotle’s. For Plato, The Real was perfect and with our poor, corrupt visual tools we can only perceive inferior copies of the real things—Platonic Ideals. While there is much that’s wrong with Plato’s philosophy, the uncovering of nature’s hidden order — free of imperfection — is the goal of modern science.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
### The Father of Physics

Nobody had ever done what Galileo did in all of history. Let’s summarize his strategies:

**First**, Galileo chose not to explain nature (motion in his case) on the basis of logical argument from within pre-conditioned philosophy (neither Aristotle’s nor the Church’s): Galileo confronted nature without precondition: he assumed that Authority did not dictate how the physical world behaves.

**Second**, rather than sit passively and observe, Galileo created artificial circumstances designed to explore particular questions: he assumed that Nature can be characterized by doing experiments.

**Third**, rather than report results as a narrative, Galileo made quantitative measurements under the assumption that arithmetical and geometrical constructions were the appropriate way to describe physical behavior. This idea that nature appears to behave according to mathematics is not new (going back to at least Pythagoras) and is the bedrock of modern physics. We don't understand why the universe is so understandably mathematical!

<aside class="myaside"> Why does Nature appear to be organized in a way that can be described using mathematics? We don't know! It's a long-standing puzzle. Somehow "it just is" is a less than satisfactory answer but also "mathematics is magic" seems also to be sort of a reach. Most of us go with...it just is, and boy is that lucky.</aside>
The first three strategies alone would make Galileo one of the first, great scientists. But he went further, and his Physics Paternity comes from his *Platonism*.

**Fourth**, Galileo chose to interpret nature as consisting of rules that can only be discovered by going beyond the rough regularities that we always see in our observations. Nature is best assumed to be simple and mathematical, but all that we can observe is complicated by extraneous effects and the true nature...um, of nature is hidden, just out of grasp. Strip away complications like friction as best you can and through mathematical modeling and extrapolation we can uncover nature’s hidden rules.

Without this **fourth** strategy, physics would be impossible.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">The rules of nature are often hidden from experiment and must be inferred by a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental confirmation. </p>

Taken together, these four strategies form the modern-looking nature of physics.

## What to Remember from Lesson \@ref(lessonmotion)? {#motionremember}
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

This has been all about motion without regard to its cause. In a slightly different order from how it was presented, we have a model of constantly accelerated motion (which is an approximation for real-world events). 

### The speed of a body is proportional to the time elapsed.

$$v = v_0 + at$$

### The distance traveled by an object undergoing constant acceleration is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.

$$x = x_0 + v_0t + 1/2at^2$$

### The distance and the speed are related through a square root.

$$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a x$$

In all of these relations, if there is no acceleration, then the $a$’s above are zero. 

### Acceleration near the Earth.

Galileo’s major contribution to the study of motion was his experiment that showed the above quadratic relation between distance and time. His work focused solely on a particular acceleration, namely that of gravity near the surface of the Earth. That particular value is important enough that it gets its own name, which we affectionately call “little $g$”:

$$g=9.8 \text{ m/s$^2$ } \approx 10 \text{ m/s$^2$ } = 32 \text{ ft/s$^2$ }$$

In this work he showed that neither the nature of the material nor the mass of a moving object affects these motions. 

### Projectile motion

Galileo also demonstrated that an object thrown at an inclination to the Earth’s surface executes a parabolic path with the horizontal component of the object’s velocity unchanging and the vertical component of the object’s velocity decelerating according to $g$ up and accelerating according to $g$ down.

### Pendulum Motion

Galileo also found that the frequency that a pendulum repeats back and forth (its period) is independent of how high up the pendulum bob is released and independent of either the mass or material of the pendulum bob. He found that the only quantity that governed this motion is the length of the string. Historically, this has been called Galileo’s Pendulum…law. 

### What Physics Is

Each of the above models are  approximations to circumstances in which there is no air resistance or friction. This means that these relations tell a story about how things move in an ideal sense. This, *Galileo taught us*, is the goal of physics: **to understand and mathematically model the basic rules of nature in ideal circumstances and then add successive “drops” of reality (like friction or air resistance) depending on the goal of one’s modeling.**
